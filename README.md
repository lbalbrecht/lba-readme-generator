# Readme Generator

## Description

This application uses npm inquirer and fs to generate and populate markdown files in order to create professional-grade readmes. With this, the user will easily be able to share repository information with new users and readers, allowing for an easy and straightforward user experience.

## Usage

In order to run the application, the user opens the integrated command terminal and runs the following command to install the requisite npm packages:

```
npm i
```

Once the npm packages are installed, the user will be able to run the program from the terminal using the following command

```
node index.js
```

When the application launches, the user will be asked to fill out a series of prompts to populate each section of the readme. The user is expected to fill out each section; however, any one can remain empty.
When the user has filled out all the prompts, the application will populate a markdown file located in the 'generated-readmes' folder.
